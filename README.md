# myAppChat
# this app was built using React and Nodejs and Bootstrap as css framework.

# some of the features required for the assesment are missing. because Im still learning on how to achieve the other requirements. it will take me few days if I will put all the missing requirements and I only have a limited time.

# this project is working fine. some of its components are scrapped from my previous practice projects. and some are from google. after finishing this project, I learned something on how this chatApp works

# to run this app:
## Clone this repository
##  `npm install`
## `npm start`
